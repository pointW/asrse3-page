In the spatial action representation, the action space spans the space of target poses for robot motion commands, i.e. $SE(2)$ or $SE(3)$. This approach has been used to solve challenging robotic manipulation problems and shows promise. However, the method is often limited to a three dimensional action space and short horizon tasks. This paper proposes ASRSE3, a new method for handling higher dimensional spatial action spaces that transforms an original MDP with high dimensional action space into a new MDP with reduced action space and augmented state space. We also propose SDQfD, a variation of DQfD designed for large action spaces. ASRSE3 and SDQfD are evaluated in the context of a set of challenging block construction tasks. We show that both methods outperform standard baselines and can be used in practice on real robotics systems.
